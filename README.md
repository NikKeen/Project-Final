# Project-Final
The Final Project is a Group Project, interaction and open communication with classmates and Instructor are vital to maintain updates for the Project and to keep tabs of who is doing what.
The main idea of the application is yet to be present, but I already have an idea of what it would be. I will present the jotted down proposal here for evetyone to see and have an idea, this law firm application will address those of personal injury especially those that are active duty military members and veterans.

Here is the brief idea, anyone is welcome to adjust and talk about more ideas for this proposal:

Application: Law firm 

Front-End: React 

Back-End: Node + Express 

Database: SQL 

Initial Features: Reactive, informative, secure, and able to branch out to other webpages if necessary while also maintaining a login and password. 

Source Control Technology: GitHub

How it would meet the minimum requirements: This is the first big step and a outline of what we will set up and execute along with the plans and ideas of my fellow classmates.

What was done: Made a background and a clickable button.

What is needed to be done: A log in page, a home page, and a nav bar for the home page with a profile and a messages from attorney to client (similar to a chat feature from LinkdIn) as well a small personal email that cleints can use securely to send over important documents to attorney's as well as receiving any sort of documention from their attorney's and paralegals.
Contain a SQL Database to contain the login's and passwords and emails connected to the client and the attorney's, paralegals, admins, and those that update the database and website.
